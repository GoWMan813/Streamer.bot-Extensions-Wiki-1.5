You can follow Nutty's [video](https://youtu.be/NuWKrpNCE1k) for setting up OBS at least with `Nested scenes` & `Dynamic Delay Filter`.
Whole effect takes about `8GB of your RAM`, so be aware of that.

Also, make sure to check all `Sub-Actions` that they are pointing at your OBS scenes, filters and sound files.

I plan on making video showing how to set this up from the start to the end

# Configuration
To get timings right with my example action use these settings for `Dynamic Delay` plugin:

Fast Forward: | `1000%`
Fast Backward: | `-1000%`
Fast Forward OBS hotkey: | `CTRL+NUM3`
