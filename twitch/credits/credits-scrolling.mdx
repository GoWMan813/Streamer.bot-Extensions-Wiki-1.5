# Tutorial

<YouTube videoId="7DrRWu_Lmu4" opts={{width:830, height:467}} />

## Video Notes/Updates

Since the release of this video some things have been added to the JS page, allowing for adding text and/or image URLs to the start and/or end of the credits as they scroll. You will find where to add them in the script.js file, lines 71-79.
Included:

-   Zipped folder with HTML, JS and CSS files
-   Video describing steps involved in adding, editing and styling credits
-   Notes to addressed updated features post-video released



# Installation

## Assets

[credits - simple scrolling.zip](/assets/credits/files/credits-simple-scrolling.zip)

Download the files needed by clicking the link above and extract the folder to where you save your files used in your stream
Add a browser source to OBS and tick the “Local File” box and then browse to the folder you just extracted. Point to the index.html file.

# Configuration

The credits are styled using the included CSS (styles.css) file. While some of the more advanced changes will take a basic understanding of web development changing the two colors and (to a certain degree) the fonts are not complicated things to do. You will need a text editor. If you are working with an unaltered style.css you fill find the following sections on the listed line of the editor:

-   Font Class Import (Google Font) ---- Line 1
-   Font Name and Size ------------------- Line 21
-   RGB Color Code For Names Listed – Line 24
-   RGB Color Code for Titles/Sections – Line 37
