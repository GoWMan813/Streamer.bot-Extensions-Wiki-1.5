## Chat Commands
`!birthday` - Allows users to check their Birthday or a Birthday of another user.
`!setbirthday` - Allows users to set their Birthday (This will only work once unless reset by a Moderator).
## Moderator Commands
`!birthdayso` - Allows Moderators to wish someone Happy Birthday if their Birthday was on a non-stream day.
`!resetbirthday` - Allows Moderators to reset a users' set Birthday so they can set it again.

In the `Actions` `Birthday Auto` and `Birthday Shoutout (Mod)` double click on the `Obs Set Browser Source Url` `Subaction` and make sure that it points to the index.html file in \Browser Sources\happy-birthday\dist.
